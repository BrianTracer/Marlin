<b>Marlin [Modular Analysis and Reconstruction for the LINear collider]</b>
is a simple modular application framework for analysis and reconstruction code based
on LCIO.

<h2>Overview</h2>

The main purpose of Marlin is to facilitate the modular development of reconstruction 
and analysis code based on LCIO. As a lot of different groups are involved it should 
be simple and straight forward to have distributed development of modules and combine 
existing modules as needed in a larger application. <br>
The base class for a Marlin module is called marlin::Processor. It defines a set of
callbacks that the user can implement in their subclasses. A steering file mechanism
allows to activate the needed processors. These are then called for every event using 
the LCEvent as container for input and output data in terms of LCCollections:

<h2>Installation</h2>

The installation of Marlin is described in the <a href="../../README">README</a>.

<h2>Running Marlin</h2>
After having installed Marlin you have to write your own marlin::Processor(s) subclass 
that performs the computation. This is fairly straight forward and Marlin provides 
an example in <a href="../../examples/mymarlin/">./examples/mymarlin</a> that can serve as a 
template for your own projects.
<p>
Note: there is no need to write a main program as this is provided by Marlin. Existing 
Processors are automatically registered with Marlin provided one instance exists in the
library as described in the <a href="../../README">README</a>.


<h3>Steering files</h3>
A Marlin application is controlled via a steering file that defines the active processors
and the order in which they are called as well as global and processor specific 
parameters. Since v00-09 two formats for the steering file exist: ascii and xml:

<h4>Ascii steering files</h4>

For an existing marlin application you can get an example steering file including sections
for  all available processors by typing:
<ul>
<li>
  <b>./bin/MyMarlinApplication -l > example.steer</b>
</li>
</ul> 
This creates a file similar to <a href="../../test.steer">./test.steer</a>.
After editing your steering file you can run the application simply by:
<ul>
<li>
  <b>./bin/MyMarlinApplication example.steer </b>
</li>
</ul> 

<h4>XML steering files</h4>

You can get an example XML steering file with:
<ul>
<li>
  <b>./bin/MyMarlinApplication -x > example.xml</b>
</li>
</ul> 
While XML steering files provide all the functionality of ascii files they also allow to make 
use of two new features:
<ul>
<li> conditional execution of processors (depending on flags set by other processors)</li>
<li> grouping of processors with sharing common parameters</li>
</ul> 

See marlin::XMLParser for a detailed description of the xml steering files.

The application is again run by:
<ul>
<li>
  <b>./bin/MyMarlinApplication example.xml</b>
</li>
</ul>
