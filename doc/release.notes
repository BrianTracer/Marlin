  Marlin release notes
 ======================
  
 -----------
| 
 -----------

 - switched to  latest version of tinyxml:  2.5.2

 - new features 'Marlin -c steer.xml' checks steering file
   for consistency (names and types of LCIO collections (author J.Engels) 

 - new features 'Marlin -f old.xml steer.xml ' adds LCIO collection
   type information to old xml steering file for usage with Marlin -c

 - new methods Processor::registerInput/OutputCollections() 
   for checking consistency 


 -----------
| v00-09-05 |
 -----------
  - introduced bool processor parameters
  - allow to skip first N events (global parameter: SkipNEvents) requires LCIO > v01-05
  

 -----------
| v00-09-04 |
 -----------
  - made compliant for use with RAIDA 
  - no new functionality, only minor fixes and documentation

 -----------
| v00-09-03 |
 -----------

 - beta code for split files if given size exceeded in LCIOOutputprocessor

 - bug fix in LCIOOutputprocessor for DropCollectionNames

 -----------
| v00-09-02 |
 -----------
  - updated documentation

  - some code cosmetics

 -----------
| v00-09-01 |
 -----------
 
  first usage of GEAR
  
  introduced userlib.gmk for USERINCLUDES and USERLIBS

 --------
| v00-09 |
 --------

  added Exceptions and Exception handler that prints error message when an
  uncaught exception is thrown

  added SkipEventException and StopProcessingException to skip the current 
  event or all following events 

  improved makefiles for Marlin:
     -	src/GNUmakefile creates marlin_includes.sh and marlin_libs.sh
        in order to build with the same libraries as have been used for 
        core Marlin
     -  new top level GNUmakefile that builds marlin together with 
        user packages containing processors in $MARLIN/packages
     -  modified example makefile for user packages
        $MARLIN/examples/mymarlin/src/GNUmakefile

  new (optional) XML steering files that provide new features:

     - conditions: Processor::processEvent will be called only if a condition
       expressed in terms of ProcessorNames as specified in the steering file is true

     - groups: processors can be grouped together so that they can share common variables
       and can be referred to in the <execute/> tag by the group name

     - TinyXml parser ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyxml ) 
       that can be used to read arbitrary xml files

  create example steering files:  
    ./bin/Marlin -l > example.steer 
    ./bin/Marlin -x > example.xml 

  LCIOOutputProcessor allows to drop collections - needs LCIO v01-05

  new method Processor::isFirstEvent() - use instead of static bool isFirstEvent

  added SimpleFastMCProcessor - simple smearing Monte Carlo - see fastMC.steer for an example

  new DataSourceProcessor class that allows reading of non-LCIO data streams
 
  StdHepReader processor that creates an LCIO data stream from an stdhep file
  (patch by J.Samson for limiting the number of events (MaxRecordNumber))

  bug fixes:
   empty lines containing whitspaces or tabs are ignored now (no seg.fault)
   processors end() method now called in reverse order of initialization !
 --------
| v00-08 |
 --------

  improved API doc
  
  bug fixes in ConditionsProcessor

  improved example/mymarlin/src/GNUmakefile

 v00-07
    
  added ConditionsProcessor for LCCD
   
  added optional parameters to Processor
 
  read chain of LCIO input files in Marlin.cc
   
  fixed problems with registered vector parameters

 v00-06 

  added examples directory that can serve as a template for user projects

  added Processr::printParameters()
 
  fixed Problem with default values of parameters 

  renamed Processr::dump() to Processr::printDescription()

 v00-05

  added Processr::check()  to be used for checkplots in reco processors
 
 v00-04    (changes wrt. to v00-03):
  
   * generates warning instead of error message if less than MaxRecordNumber records read

   * improved handling/documentation of steering parameters / modules

     - Marlin -l : lists all kown modules and their steering parameters
		   with description and default values
                   in a format that can be copied to a  steering file 

       -> use Processor::registerProcessorParameter(name, description, parameter, defaultVal ) ;
          to declare your parameters

     - leading whitespace allowed in steering file to improve readability


   * new AIDAProcessor for producing AIDA/root histograms:

    - handles AIDA file for all modules 
    - modules simply create and fill their histograms
    - uses JAIDA/AIDAJNI AIDA-implementation 
    - not mandatory - could still use root but preferred  for 'official' processors/modules
