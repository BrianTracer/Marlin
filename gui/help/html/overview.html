	<p>Marlin GUI is a graphical user interface for interactively create or repair Marlin XML steering files.</p>
	<p>It has various separate sections equivalent to the ones you are already familiarized with from a normal<br>
	steering file: (global section, execute section, GEAR file, LCIO Input files, etc...)<br>
	It has an automatic consistency-checking feature that allows you to constantly and instantly check if the<br>
	steering file contains errors.</p>
	<p>The consistency check tests if every active processor is installed and has all the required input collections<br>
	available from previous processors or from the LCIO files declared in the global section.<br>
	It also checks if there are duplicate collections defined in the event, or if every file or symbolic link specified<br>
	in the steering is valid.</p>
	<p>This GUI is based on the MarlinSteeringCheck command line tool which you can check out by running:<br>
	"Marlin -c steeringFile.xml". Altough this tool is enough for checking the consistency of a steering file, it<br>
	doesn't give you the chance to modify it and repair the errors found, if any.</p>
	<p>The GUI also provides you the possibility to create a new steering file from scratch, where you can just with<br>
	a few clicks add the processors you need and change their default parameter values to the ones you require for your job.</p>
	<p>Marlin GUI was designed with the main goal of substituting the fastidious and error-prone task of editing Marlin XML<br>
	steering files by hand with an, as much as possible, productive, error-free and intuitive way for physicists.</p>

	<div align=center><img src="../images/overview_lciocollections.png" border=2></img></div><br>
	
	<p>This table located at the upper left corner of the layout is only a list of all collections<br>
	found in the first 30 Events from each of the <a href="global.html#lciofiles"> LCIO Files </a> added in the
	<a href="global.html"> Global Section </a>.</p>
	<p>The number of events read each time you load an LCIO file can be defined in the<br>
	header file "$MARLIN/include/marlin/MarlinSteerCheck.h" under the variable<br>
	"MAXEVENTS" in the top of the file. Please note that if you change this value<br>
	you need to recompile Marlin and the GUI so that changes take effect.</p>
